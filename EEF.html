                            <p>My name is Keiko Climaco and I am your uOttawa Head Delegate to CUSEC 2015. I've set this page up to update the students about any necessary information about my goals, duties and activities as HD this year.</p>
                            <p>This page also hopes to acknowledge any professors, institutions and organizations that will lend us a helping hand to enable students to go to CUSEC.</p>
                            <p>This year, my main goal is to achieve the LARGEST EVER uOttawa Delegation to CUSEC 2015. 35 out of the 49 students from last year's delegation are still students. Therefore, I should have absolutely no problem with that goal. However, I also hope to achieve that feat with every student going to CUSEC at a reasonable price. I will be working hard to find methods to subsidize costs for the entire delegation. If you would like to make a contribution, or know of any possible methods of sponsorship and funding: please let me know! :D</p>
                            <p>I also hope to encourage younger students to start going to CUSEC early. I think that it's important to realize early, the amount of tools and knowledge there is out there to become successful developers in the future.</p>
                            <p>I am aiming to encourage a higher participation rate of uOttawa students in CUSEC's events like DemoCamp and Resume Roast. By providing an incentive, I hope that the all members of our delegation will be encouraged to show other schools what uOttawa engineers, computer scientists and enthusiasts are made of.</p>
                            <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
